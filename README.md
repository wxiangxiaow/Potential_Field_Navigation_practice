# Potential_Field_Navigation_practice
A test of potential field navigation practice.

The work area is a square from (0,0) to (14,14) in the (x,y) plane.  The goal is at (12,12).  There are obstacles at (5,6) and (7,6).  Use a repulsive potential of K^i^/r^i^ for each obstacle, with r^i^ the vector to the i-th obstacle.  For the target use an attractive potential of K^T^r^T^ , with r^T^ the vector to the target.
